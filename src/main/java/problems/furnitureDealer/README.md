    Optimization problem
    A furniture dealer deals in only two itemsâ€“tables and
    chairs. He has Rs 50,000 to invest and has storage space
    of at most 60 pieces. A table costs Rs 2500 and a chair
    Rs 500. He estimates that from the sale of one table, he
    can make a profit of Rs 250 and that from the sale of one
    chair a profit of Rs 75. He wants to know how many tables and chairs he should buy from the
    available money so as to maximise his total profit, assuming that he can sell all the items which he buys.

    Linear programming problem is one that is concerned with finding the optimal value of a linear function of
    several variables, subject to the condition that the variables are non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities
